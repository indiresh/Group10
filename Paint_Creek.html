      <p>Paint Creek deserves a special marking in my book. When I was young and impressionable, this trail implanted a tremendous sense of curiosity. &quot;If there is a 10 mile trail out here, what else could there be?!&quot; Not only that, it served as a good initial workout, from memory the first one I had ever had. Because of that and it's natural beauty, it's a special path for me. </p>
    <p>Videos:<br />
    Unfortunately, I have no clear videos of this path.      I've recorded it before, but my camera fogged up and the image became undesirable. </p>
    <p>      However, since
    we're on the topic of memorable trails, this is one that also helped me get started in biking. For 3 months straight, I was up at sunrise doing this ride. </p>
